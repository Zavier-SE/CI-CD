# CI-CD
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

In terms of definition, Continuous integration(CI) is a development practice requiring developers to regularly integrate their own code into the shared/central repository, likely several times a day. And automation tools are introduced to build, package and do unit tests on a dedicated build server to provide immediate feedback through email to the developers. The above processes will be automatically triggered when the programmer submits their code. Continuous Delivery(CD) is a software development practice where software can be released to production anytime. The automated scripts automated the process, such as setting up the test environment and deploying the software after the quality insurance team confirms, making the release process efficient and repeatable.

One of the necessary tools needed for CI/CD is a source control system, and it is usually Git. Git allows keeping track of the changes programmers made to all the files inside a project, manages branches and merges codes. A remote repository on the cloud is needed for the developers in the team to access and push changes to and for the build server to access. Some examples are GitHub, Gitlab and Bitbucket. And next, we need to bring in the CI tools to build and package the code and run the unit tests. Some tools are introduced by the remote repository host, such as GitHub Actions and GitLab CI. And the most popular one is Jenkins, an open-source automation server that can help automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying.
