# CI-CD
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)

In terms of definition, Continuous integration(CI) is a development practice requiring developers to regularly integrate their own code into the shared/central repository, likely several times a day. And automation tools are introduced to build, package and do unit tests on a dedicated build server to provide immediate feedback through email to the developers. The above processes will be automatically triggered when the programmer commits their code. It could move towards the Continuous Delivery pipeline if the unit tests pass. Continuous Delivery(CD) is a software development practice where software can be released to production anytime. The operation team maintains the automated scripts to automate the process, making the release process efficient and repeatable. Depending on the requirement, the CD pipeline could include setting up the test environment, deploying the software to the test environment and distributing the new version to all users after the quality insurance team confirms.

One of the necessary tools needed for CI/CD is a source control system, and it is usually Git. Git allows keeping track of the changes programmers made to all the files inside a project, manages branches and merges codes. A remote repository on the cloud is needed for the developers to work as a team to access and push changes to and for the build server to access. Some examples are GitHub, Gitlab and Bitbucket. And next, we need to bring in the CI tools to build and package the code and run the unit tests. Some tools are introduced by the remote repository host, such as GitHub Actions and GitLab CI. And the most popular one is Jenkins, an open-source automation server that can help automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying. Other similar ones are CircleCI and App Center etc. After CI tools build the code and create the artifacts, the next step is to deploy the solution. Most of the above tools also support building the CD pipeline, and Jenkins, again, is the most popular one. Other available CD tools on the market are AWS CodeDeploy, Azure DevOps Project etc.
